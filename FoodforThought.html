<h5>Food for Thought</h5>

Steam wisps curl from the cup of Earl Grey</p>
on a round pink table in my tea room.</p>
I am perched on an absinthe-shaded chair,</p>
but my eyes do not rise above the surface</p>
to see mini cakes displayed on a powder blue plate. </p>

I reach out to the assortment filled with children’s tales,</p>
tempting me to dip my finger in the center frosting.</p>
The fondant leather binding covers each petit four,</p>
the colors are rich, and the pages smell sweet.</p>
My mouth watering at the enticing, bite-sized details.</p>

One nibble in, my torso lengthens and I can see</p>
above the table at the plethora of other indulgences.</p>
They whisper out, “Eat Me.”</p>
<p></p>
Dark chocolate crossed pretzel wands decorate</p>
A cream envelope sealed with blood-stone sprinkles.</p>
I’m filled with a new magic</p>
That stimulates me to continue the stories of Rowling’s</p>
Characters through new situations that I articulate.</p>

Joining me at the table, a red royal and a white hare</p>
who draw me into a lavish disconnect from reality.</p>
The characters invite me to take another bite,</p>
to pour another cup of tea, and lose track of time.</p>
And reveal tastebuds of which I was unaware.</p>

Another bite, I hallucinate, seeing colors previously unread.</p>
They swirl and blend as the flavors</p>
in my mouth and the ideas in my head.</p>

Sugar-free icing on Plath, Orwell, and Bradbury.</p>
I savor the dense, bitter flavors</p>
and wince knowing a tart perspective</p>
different from the nectar I’ve known before,</p>
written with a melt-in-your-mouth style, yet airy.</p>

I grow out of my house, lengthways</p>
towering tiers above my family.</p>
I send words tumbling down the hole</p>
in the roof, but their minds remain</p>
under their traditional glaze.</p>

Returning to the children’s tales, most adults would find improper,</p>
But, I can alohomora my own adventures</p>
And taste again what it’s like to be smaller.</p>

Blending the complex flavors with the simply sweet,</p>
I bake a scrumptious confection in my mind</p>
Of cakes and other poetic fancies</p>
bursting with promise to nourish my thoughts.</p>
They call out, “Read me.”</p>
